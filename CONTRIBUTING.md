# Contributing Guidelines

## Code ways

### Opening a pull request

Simply fork this project on gitlab (or github - where I've mirrored this).

Then clone your fork and make your changes and then do

```bash
git checkout -b your_branch_name
git push origin your_branch_name
```

Gitlab or Github should then prompt you to make a pull request where you
can enter whatever detail there is.

Please put as much information on the change as possible.

## Non code ways

### Finding a bug

### Feature Request

Maybe you have a good feature to add, please use the [same following page](https://gitlab.com/nolim1t/docker-clightning/-/issues/new) and enter in
the details for your feature as well as whatever reason/justification for it.

It will be read and probably not ignored.

### Donations

Monetary donations is another way of receiving support for maintaining. Most of us Open Source developers are completely independent and without sponsors, while we build the internet and further development in this space.

The following [page](https://nolim1t.co/tips/) lets you donate via Lightning / on-chain bitcoin or DAI. This will 100% go to a HODL address for now.
