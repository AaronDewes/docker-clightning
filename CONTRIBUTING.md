# Contributing Guidelines

## Code ways

### Opening a pull request

Simply fork this project on gitlab (or github - where I've mirrored this).

Then clone your fork and make your changes and then do

```bash
git checkout -b your_branch_name
git push origin your_branch_name
```

Gitlab or Github should then prompt you to make a pull request where you
can enter whatever detail there is.

Please put as much information on the change as possible.
